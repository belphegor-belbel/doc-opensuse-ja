msgid "In addition to image building capabilities, Podman (see <xref linkend=\"sec-build-tools-podman\"/> ) features a container deployment engine. This engine uses the concept of pods&mdash;a group of containers that operate together. Pods can also be thought of as a way to group related containers together for easier management. Podman deploys each container as its own process, thus providing and efficient and easy way of creating interconnected containers."
