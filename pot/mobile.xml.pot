msgid "A desktop system or a laptop can communicate with mobile devices via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a direct USB connection. Choosing a connection method depends on your mobile device model and your specific needs. Connecting a mobile device to a desktop machine or laptop via USB usually makes it possible to work with the device as conventional external storage. Setting up a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection allows you to interact with the mobile device and control its functions directly from your desktop machine or laptop. There are several open-source graphical utilities you can use to control the connected mobile device (notably <link xlink:href=\"https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect\">KDE Connect</link> and <link xlink:href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/\">GSConnect</link> )."
