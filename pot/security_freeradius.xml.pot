msgid "The RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol has long been a standard service for manage network access. It provides authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) for large businesses such as Internet service providers and cellular network providers, and is also popular for small networks. It authenticates users and devices, authorizes those users and devices for certain network services, and tracks use of services for billing and auditing. You do not have to use all three of the AAA protocols, but only the ones you need. For example, you may not need accounting but only client authentication, or perhaps all you want is accounting, and client authorization is managed by something else."
