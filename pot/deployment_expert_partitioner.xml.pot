msgid "Sophisticated system configurations require specific disk setups. All common partitioning tasks can be done during the installation. To get persistent device naming with block devices, use the block devices below <filename>/dev/disk/by-id</filename> or <filename>/dev/disk/by-uuid</filename> . Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a disk partitioning scheme that is designed to be much more flexible than the physical partitioning used in standard setups. Its snapshot functionality enables easy creation of data backups. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) offers increased data integrity, performance, and fault tolerance. &productname; also supports multipath I/O <phrase os=\"sles\"> (see <xref linkend=\"cha.multipath\"/> for details)</phrase> . There is also the option to use iSCSI as a networked disk <phrase os=\"sles\"> (read more about iSCSI in <xref linkend=\"cha.iscsi\"/>)</phrase> ."
