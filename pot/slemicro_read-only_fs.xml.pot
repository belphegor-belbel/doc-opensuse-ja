msgid "&slema; was designed to use a read-only root file system. This means that after the deployment is complete, you are not able to perform direct modifications to the root file system, e.g. by using <command>zypper</command> . Instead, &slem; introduces the concept of transactional updates which enables you to modify your system and keep it up to date."
