msgid "In networked environments, it is often necessary to access hosts from a remote location. If a user sends login and password strings for authentication purposes as plain text, they could be intercepted and misused to gain access to that user account. This would open all the user's files to an attacker and the illegal account could be used to obtain administrator or <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> access, or to penetrate other systems. In the past, remote connections were established with <command>telnet</command> , <command>rsh</command> or <command>rlogin</command> , which offered no guards against eavesdropping in the form of encryption or other security mechanisms. There are other unprotected communication channels, like the traditional FTP protocol and some remote copying programs like <command>rcp</command> ."

msgid "The SSH suite provides the necessary protection by encrypting the authentication strings and all the other data exchanged between the hosts. With SSH, the data flow could still be recorded by a third party, but the contents are encrypted and cannot be reverted to plain text unless the encryption key is known. So SSH enables secure communication over insecure networks, such as the Internet. The SSH implementation in &productname; is OpenSSH."
