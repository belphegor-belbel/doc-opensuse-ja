msgid "OpenSSH is the SSH (secure shell) implementation that ships with &productname;, for securing network operations such as remote administration, file transfers, and tunneling insecure protocols. SSH encrypts all traffic between two hosts, including authentication, to protect against eavesdropping and connection hijacking. This chapter covers basic operations, plus host key rotation and certificate authentication, which are useful for managing larger SSH deployments."
