This can be done either per individual backup archive or for the complete backup file system, if applicable. Should a backup medium ever be lost, for example during transportation, the data will be protected against unauthorized access. The same applies if a backup system itself is compromised. To some extent encryption also ensures the integrity of the backups. Keep in mind, however, that the appropriate people need to be able to decrypt backups in emergency situations. Also, the case that an encryption key itself is compromised and needs to be replaced should be considered."
