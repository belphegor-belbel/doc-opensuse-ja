Keeping access time always up to date has significant performance overhead since every read-only access will incur a write operation. Thus by default every file system updates access time only if current file access time is older than a day or if it is older than file modification or change time. This feature is called <emphasis>relative access time</emphasis> and the corresponding mount option is <option>relatime</option> . Updates of access time can be completely disabled using the <option>noatime</option> mount option, however you need to verify your applications do not use it. This can be true for file and Web servers or for network storage. If the default relative access time update policy is not suitable for your applications, use the <option>strictatime</option> mount option."

The caveat of this feature is that standard writes are cached in the page cache and are written back to persistent storage only later by an independent kernel process. Thus the I/O priority setting generally does not apply for these writes. Also be aware that I/O class and priority setting are obeyed only by <emphasis>BFQ</emphasis> I/O scheduler for blk-mq I/O path (refer to <xref linkend=\"cha-tuning-io-schedulers-blkmq\"/> ).
