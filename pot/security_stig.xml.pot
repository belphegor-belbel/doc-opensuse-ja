msgid "When a &stig; is implemented for a system, the system is hardened. The goals are to minimize attacks and to prevent system access (both physically and via a network) and to define processes for maintenance (applying software updates) and vulnerability patching. &stig;s can also cover configuration settings, for example, for operating systems, routers, databases, firewall rules, domain name servers and switches."
