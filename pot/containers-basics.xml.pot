msgid "The Linux kernel has some powerful capabilities to put system processes in isolated environments called containers. Two specific Linux Kernel features, namespaces and kernel control groups (see <xref linkend=\"cha-tuning-cgroups\"/> ) implement the container isolation from the rest of the host system or other containers. Thus Linux containers offer a lightweight \"virtualization method\" to run multiple isolated environments (containers) simultaneously on a single host. Unlike technologies like &xen; or &kvm;, where the processor simulates a complete hardware environment through a virtualization layer, Linux containers share and use directly the host OS kernel. This decrease the kernel overhead required for accessing the operating system resources an in turn allow for better performance in general, compare to a generic Virtual Machine environment."
