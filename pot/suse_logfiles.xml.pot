msgid "There are several system services ( <emphasis>daemons</emphasis> ) that, along with the kernel itself, regularly record the system status and specific events onto log files. This way, the administrator can regularly check the status of the system at a certain point in time, recognize errors or faulty functions and troubleshoot them with pinpoint precision. These log files are normally stored in <filename>/var/log</filename> as specified by FHS and grow on a daily basis. The <systemitem>logrotate</systemitem> package helps control the growth of these files. For more details refer to <xref linkend=\"sec-tuning-syslog-logrotate\"/> ."
