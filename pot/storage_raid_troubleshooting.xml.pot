msgid "Check the <filename>/proc/mdstat</filename> file to find out whether a RAID partition has been damaged. If a disk fails, shut down your Linux system and replace the defective hard disk with a new one partitioned the same way. Then restart your system and enter the command <command>mdadm /dev/mdX --add /dev/sdX</command> . Replace <literal>X</literal> with your particular device identifiers. This integrates the hard disk automatically into the RAID system and fully reconstructs it (for all RAID levels except for RAID&nbsp;0)."
