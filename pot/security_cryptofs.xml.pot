However, encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult, because you need to resize and change existing partitions. In such cases, it may be more convenient to create an encrypted file of a defined size, in which to <emphasis>store</emphasis> other files or parts of your file system. To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout. The standard partitioning proposal, as suggested by &yast;, does not include an encrypted partition by default. Add an encrypted partition manually in the partitioning dialog."
