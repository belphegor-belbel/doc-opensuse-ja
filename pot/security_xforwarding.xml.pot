msgid "Network transparency is one of the central characteristics of a Unix system. X, the windowing system of Unix operating systems, can use this feature in an impressive way. With X, it is no problem to log in to a remote host and start a graphical program that is then sent over the network to be displayed on your computer."

msgid "When an X client needs to be displayed remotely using an X server, the latter should protect the resource managed by it (the display) from unauthorized access. In more concrete terms, certain permissions must be given to the client program. With the X Window System, there are two ways to do this, called host-based access control and cookie-based access control. The former relies on the IP address of the host where the client should run. The program to control this is <command>xhost</command> . <command>xhost</command> enters the IP address of a legitimate client into a database belonging to the X server. However, relying on IP addresses for authentication is not secure. For example, if there were a second user working on the host sending the client program, that user would have access to the X server as well&mdash;like someone spoofing the IP address. Because of these shortcomings, this authentication method is not described in more detail here, but you can learn about it with <command>man</command> &nbsp; <option>xhost</option> ."

msgid "For cookie-based access control, a character string is generated that is only known to the X server and to the legitimate user, like an ID card. This cookie is stored on login in the file <filename>.Xauthority</filename> in the user's home directory and is available to any X client wanting to use the X server to display a window. The file <filename>.Xauthority</filename> can be examined by the user with the tool <command>xauth</command> . If you rename <filename>.Xauthority</filename> , or if you delete the file from your home directory by accident, you cannot open any new windows or X clients."

msgid "SSH (secure shell) can be used to encrypt a network connection and forward it to an X server transparently. This is also called X forwarding. X forwarding is achieved by simulating an X server on the server side and setting a DISPLAY variable for the shell on the remote host. Further details about SSH can be found in <xref linkend=\"cha-ssh\"/> ."

msgid "If you do not consider the computer where you log in to be a secure host, do not use X forwarding. If X forwarding is enabled, an attacker could authenticate via your SSH connection. The attacker could then intrude on your X server and, for example, read your keyboard input."
