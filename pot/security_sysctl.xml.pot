msgid "Sysctl (system control) variables control certain kernel parameters that influence the behavior of different parts of the operating system, for example the Linux network stack. These parameters can be looked up in the <literal>proc</literal> file system, in <filename>/proc/sys</filename> . Many kernel parameters can be changed directly by writing a new value into a parameter pseudo file. However, these changes are not persisted and are lost after a system reboot. Therefore, we recommend configuring all changes in a sysctl configuration file to have them applied at every system start."

msgid "This enables TCP SYN Cookie Protection for IPv4 <emphasis>and</emphasis> IPv6. It addresses a specific denial-of-service attack on the TCP protocol level. The protection involves a small CPU trade-off in favor of avoiding memory exhaustion caused by attackers. The protection mechanism consists of a fallback algorithm that only comes into play when no further TCP connections can be accepted the normal way. The mechanism is not fully TCP protocol compliant and can thus cause protocol issues in some TCP contexts. The alternative would be to drop additional connections completely in overload scenarios. This also needs a differentiation between legitimate high TCP load and a TCP denial-of-service attack. If you expect a high load of TCP connections on your system, then this setting could be counterproductive."
