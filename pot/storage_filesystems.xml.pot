msgid "At the creation time of an XFS file system, the block device underlying the file system is divided into eight or more linear regions of equal size. Those are called <emphasis>allocation groups</emphasis> . Each allocation group manages its own inodes and free disk space. Practically, allocation groups can be seen as file systems in a file system. Because allocation groups are rather independent of each other, more than one of them can be addressed by the kernel simultaneously. This feature is the key to XFS’s great scalability. Naturally, the concept of independent allocation groups suits the needs of multiprocessor systems."

The use of B <superscript>+</superscript> trees greatly contributes to XFS’s performance and scalability. XFS uses <emphasis>delayed allocation</emphasis> , which handles allocation by breaking the process into two pieces. A pending transaction is stored in RAM and the appropriate amount of space is reserved. XFS still does not decide where exactly (in file system blocks) the data should be stored. This decision is delayed until the last possible moment. Some short-lived temporary data might never make its way to disk, because it is obsolete by the time XFS decides where to save it. In this way, XFS increases write performance and reduces file system fragmentation. Because delayed allocation results in less frequent write events than in other file systems, it is likely that data loss after a crash during a write is more severe."

After a system outage when the file system could not be cleanly unmounted, e2fsck starts to analyze the file system data. Metadata is brought into a consistent state and pending files or data blocks are written to a designated directory (called <filename>lost+found</filename> ). In contrast to journaling file systems, e2fsck analyzes the entire file system and not only the recently modified bits of metadata. This takes significantly longer than checking the log data of a journaling file system. Depending on file system size, this procedure can take half an hour or more. Therefore, it is not desirable to choose Ext2 for any server that needs high availability. However, because Ext2 does not maintain a journal and uses less memory, it is sometimes faster than other file systems."

This means your metadata is always kept in a consistent state, but this cannot be automatically guaranteed for the file system data itself. Ext4 is designed to take care of both metadata and data. The degree of <quote>care</quote> can be customized. Mounting Ext4 in the <option>data=journal</option> mode offers maximum security (data integrity), but can slow down the system because both metadata and data are journaled. Another approach is to use the <option>data=ordered</option> mode, which ensures both data and metadata integrity, but uses journaling only for metadata. The file system driver collects all data blocks that correspond to one metadata update. These data blocks are written to disk before the metadata is updated. As a result, consistency is achieved for metadata and data without sacrificing performance. A third mount option to use is <option>data=writeback</option> , which allows data to be written to the main file system after its metadata has been committed to the journal. This option is often considered the best in performance. It can, however, allow old data to reappear in files after crash and recovery while internal file system integrity is maintained.
