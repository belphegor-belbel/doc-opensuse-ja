msgid "A disk cache is a memory used to speed up the process of storing and accessing data from the hard disk. Physical hard disks have their cache integrated as a standard feature. For virtual disks, the cache uses &vmhost;'s memory and you can fine-tune its behavior, for example, by setting its type."

msgid "Normally, a disk cache stores the most recent and frequently used programs and data. When a user or program requests data, the operating system first checks the disk cache. If the data is there, the operating system quickly delivers the data to the program instead of re-reading the data from the disk."
