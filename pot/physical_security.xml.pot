Cage locks can help prevent someone from tampering or stealing devices/media from the servers, or opening the cases and directly manipulating/sabotaging the hardware.

While locks are sometimes a useful feature, they are lower quality and easily defeated by attackers with ill intent."

For most use cases, it is enough to set an administrator password and restrict booting to the built-in hard disk. This way an attacker is not able to simply boot a Linux live CD or flash drive, for example.

A search for <quote>dod disk wipe utility</quote> yields several variants. To retire servers with sensitive data, it is important to ensure that data cannot be recovered from the hard disks. To ensure that all traces of data are removed, a wipe utility&mdash;such as <command>scrub</command> &mdash;can be used. Many wipe utilities overwrite the data several times. This assures that even sophisticated methods are not able to retrieve any parts of the wiped data. Some tools can even be operated from a bootable removable device and remove data according to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) standards. Many government agencies specify their own standards for data security. Some standards are stronger than others, yet may require more time to implement."
