msgid "Most server racks in data centers include a locking feature. Usually this will be a hasp/cylinder lock on the front of the rack that allows you to turn an included key to a locked or unlocked position&mdash;granting or denying entry. Cage locks can help prevent someone from tampering or stealing devices/media from the servers, or opening the cases and directly manipulating/sabotaging the hardware. Preventing system reboots or the booting from alternate devices is also important (for example CD/DVDs/USB drives/etc.)."

Many systems are designed to self-disable if attempts are made to open the system without unlocking. Others have device covers that will not let you plug in or unplug keyboards or mice. While locks are sometimes a useful feature, they are usually lower quality and easily defeated by attackers with ill intent."

Other hardware types (&ipseries;, &zseries;) that run Linux also have low-level firmware that performs similar functions as the PC BIOS. When this document references the BIOS, it usually means BIOS and/or UEFI. The BIOS dictates system configuration, puts the system into a well defined state and provides routines for accessing low-level hardware. The BIOS executes the configured Linux boot loader (like &grub;) to boot the host."

msgid "Most BIOS implementations can be configured to prevent unauthorized users from manipulating system and boot settings. This is typically done by setting a BIOS admin or boot password. The admin password only needs to be entered for changing the system configuration but the boot password will be required during every normal boot. For most use cases it is enough to set an admin password and restrict booting to the built-in hard disk. This way an attacker will not be able to simply boot a Linux live CD or USB thumb drive, for example. Although this does not provide a high level of security (a BIOS can be reset, removed or modified&mdash;assuming case access), it can be another deterrent."

A search of <quote>dod disk wipe utility</quote> will yield several variants. To retire servers with sensitive data, it is important to ensure that data cannot be recovered from the hard disks. To ensure that all traces of data are removed, a wipe utility&mdash;such as <command>scrub</command> &mdash;can be used. Many wipe utilities overwrite the data several times. This assures that even sophisticated methods are not able to retrieve any parts of the wiped data. Some tools can even be operated from a bootable removable device and remove data according to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) standards. Note that many government agencies specify their own standards for data security. Some standards are stronger than others, yet may require more time to implement."
