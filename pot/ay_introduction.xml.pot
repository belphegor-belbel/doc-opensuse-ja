msgid "To avoid this, you could do mass deployments by copying the hard disk of the first successful installation. Unfortunately, that leads to the issue that even minute configuration changes between each machine need to later be dealt with individually. For example, when using static IP addresses, these IP addresses would need to be reset for each machine."

msgid "A regular installation of &productname; is semi-automated by default. The user is prompted to select the necessary information at the beginning of the installation (usually language only). &yast; then generates a proposal for the underlying system depending on different factors and system parameters. Usually&mdash;and especially for new systems&mdash;such a proposal can be used to install the system and provides a usable installation. The steps following the proposal are fully automated."

msgid "Using &ay;, multiple systems can easily be installed in parallel and quickly. They need to share the same environment and similar, but not necessarily identical, hardware. The installation is defined by an XML configuration file (usually named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> ) called the <quote>&ay; profile</quote> . You can create this using existing configuration resources, and easily tailor it for any specific environment."
