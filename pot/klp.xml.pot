However, it may not be technically feasible to create live patches for all fixes that fall under the specified categories. &suse; therefore reserves the right to skip fixes in situations where creating a kernel live patch is not possible for technical reasons. Currently, over 95% of qualifying fixes are released as live patches.

This is done by redirecting calls to old code to updated code in a different memory location. Changes in data structures make the situation more complicated, as the data remain in place and cannot be extended or reinterpreted. While there are techniques that allow indirect alteration of data structures, some fixes cannot be converted to live patches. In this situation, a system restart is the only way to apply the fixes."
