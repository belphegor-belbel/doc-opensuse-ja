msgid "If your organization does any work for the United States federal government, it is likely that your cryptography applications (such as openSSL, GnuTLS, and OpenJDK) will be required to be in compliance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2. FIPS 140-2 is a security accreditation program for validating cryptographic modules produced by private companies. If your organization is not required by compliance rules to run &sle; in FIPS mode, it is most likely best to not do it. This chapter provides guidance on enabling FIPS mode, and links to resources with detailed information."

The FIPS 140-3 standard was approved in March 2019, and is replacing 140-2. CMVP is no longer accepting modules for FIPS 140-2 testing, but only FIPS 140-3."
