msgid "&tunedapp; is a daemon for Linux systems that monitors CPU and disk usage and adjusts specific settings to optimize system performance under certain workloads. Other system settings, such as those configured via <command>sysctl</command> , are applied when the service starts, and remain static unless manually reloaded. &tunedapp; offers predefined tuning profiles tailored for common use cases such as servers and virtual machines, as well as the ability to create custom profiles. &tunedapp; leverages several tuning plug-ins that interact with underlying Linux subsystems to tune the CPU, disk I/O, networking, virtual memory, power management and other components."
