"Most installations are to a local hard disk. Therefore, it is necessary for "
"the hard disk controllers to be available to the installation system. If a "
"special controller (like a RAID controller) needs an extra kernel module, "
"provide a kernel module update disk to the installation system."

"Other installation targets may be various types of block devices that "
"provide sufficient disk space and speed to run an operating system. This "
"includes network block devices like <systemitem>iSCSI</systemitem> or "
"<systemitem>SAN</systemitem> . It is also possible to install on network "
"file systems that offer the standard Unix permissions. However, it may be "
"problematic to boot these, because they must be supported by the "
"<systemitem>initramfs</systemitem> before the actual system can start. Such "
"installations can be useful when you need to start the same system in "
"different locations or you plan to use virtualization features like domain "
"migration."
