"When a &stig; is implemented for a system, the system is hardened. The goals "
"are to minimize attacks and to prevent system access (both physically and "
"via a network) and to define processes for maintenance (applying software "
"updates) and vulnerability patching. &stig;s can also cover configuration "
"settings, for example, for operating systems, routers, databases, firewalls, "
"domain name servers and switches."
