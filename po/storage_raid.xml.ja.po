"The purpose of RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is to combine "
"several hard disk partitions into one large virtual hard disk to optimize "
"performance, data security, or both. Most RAID controllers use the SCSI "
"protocol because it can address a larger number of hard disks in a more "
"effective way than the IDE protocol and is more suitable for parallel "
"processing of commands. There are some RAID controllers that support IDE or "
"SATA hard disks. Software RAID provides the advantages of RAID systems "
"without the additional cost of hardware RAID controllers. However, this "
"requires some CPU time and has memory requirements that make it unsuitable "
"for real high performance computers."

"read access is significantly faster in comparison to any one of the normal "
"physical hard disks, because the data is duplicated so can be scanned in "
