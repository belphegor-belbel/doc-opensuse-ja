"There are several system services ( <emphasis>daemons</emphasis> ) that, "
"along with the kernel itself, regularly record the system status and "
"specific events onto log files. This way, the administrator can regularly "
"check the status of the system at a certain point in time, recognize errors "
"or faulty functions and troubleshoot them with pinpoint precision. These log "
"files are normally stored in <filename>/var/log</filename> as specified by "
"FHS and grow on a daily basis. The <systemitem>logrotate</systemitem> "
"package helps control the growth of these files. For more details refer to "
"<xref linkend=\"sec.tuning.logfiles.logrotate\"/> ."
