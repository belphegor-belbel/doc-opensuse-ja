"<link xlink:href=\"https://podman.io/\">Podman</link> is short for Pod "
"Manager Tool. It is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, "
"and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers on a Linux system, "
"and it offers a drop-in alternative for &docker;. &podman; is the default "
"container runtime in &opensuse; Kubic&mdash;a certified Kubernetes "
"distribution built on top of &opensuse;. &podman; can be used to create OCI-"
"compliant container images using a Dockerfile and a range of commands "
"identical to &deng;. For example, the <literal>podman build</literal> "
"command performs the same task as <literal>docker build</literal> . In other "
"words, &podman; provides a drop-in replacement for &deng;."

"Moving from &deng; to &podman; does not require any changes in the "

"&podman; does not uses a daemon, so the container engine interacts directly "
"with an image registry, containers, and image storage. As &podman; does not "
"have a daemon, it provides integration with systemd. This makes it possible "
"to control containers via systemd units. You can create these units for "
"existing containers as well as generate units that can start containers if "
"they do not exist in the system. Moreover, &podman; can run systemd inside "
"containers."

"Because &podman; relies on several namespaces, which provide an isolation "
"mechanism for Linux processes, it does not require root privileges to create "
"and run containers. This means that &podman; can run in the root mode as "
"well as in an unpriviledged environment. Moreover, a container created by an "
"unprivileged user cannot get higher privileges on the host than the "
"container's creator."
