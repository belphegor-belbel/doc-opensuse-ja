"Systemd supports starting services with socket-based activation, for "
"starting services on demand. These services have two unit types: service and "
"socket. For example, CUPS is controlled by <filename>cups.service</filename> "
"and <filename>cups.socket</filename> . &yast; allows you to select the type "
"of service startup you want to use."
