msgid "&suse; extensively uses backports, for example for the migration of current software fixes and features into released &sle; packages. The information in this chapter explains why it can be misleading to compare version numbers to judge the capabilities and the security of &sle; software packages. This chapter also explains how &suse; keeps the system software secure and current while maintaining compatibility for your application software on top of &sle; products. You will also learn how to check which public security issues actually are addressed in your &sle; system software, and the current status of your software. <!--To do so, we first provide some background on how free software is developed and how it gets into Linux distributions.-->"

For packages in that class, occasionally newer versions are introduced into a released version of an enterprise product line."

msgid "Because of the practice of backporting, one cannot simply compare version numbers to determine whether a &suse; package contains a fix for a particular issue or has had a particular feature added to it. With backporting, the upstream part of a &suse; package's version number merely indicates what upstream version the &suse; package is based on. It may contain bug fixes and features that are not in the corresponding upstream release, but that have been backported into the &suse; package."

Some security vulnerability scanning tools (or particular tests in such tools) operate solely on version information. These tools and tests are therefore prone to generating <quote>false positives</quote> (when a piece of software is incorrectly identified as vulnerable) when backports are involved. When evaluating reports from security scanning tools, always check whether an entry is based on a version number or on an actual vulnerability test."
