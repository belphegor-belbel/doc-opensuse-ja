"Docker is a system for creating and managing containers. Its core is the "
"Docker Open Source Engine&mdash;a lightweight virtualization solution to run "
"containers simultaneously on a single host. Docker containers are defined "
"using Dockerfiles. A Dockerfile describes how to assemble a private "
"filesystem for a container. The file can also contain metadata that "
"describes how to run the container. Most Dockerfiles start from a parent "
"image. For an introduction on how to create custom base &sle; Docker images, "

"Podman is short for Pod Manager tool, and its purpose extends beyond just "
"building images. It is a daemonless container engine for developing, "
"managing, and running Open Containers Initiative (OCI) containers on a Linux "
"system, and it offers a drop-in alternative for Docker. Podman is the "
"default container runtime in openSUSE Kubic&mdash;a certified Kubernetes "
"distribution built on top of &opensuse;. Podman can be used to create OCI-"
"compliant container images using a Dockerfile and a range of commands "
"similar to Docker. For example, the <literal>podman build</literal> command "
"performs the same task as <literal>docker build</literal> , except that it "
"does not use the Docker daemon to do it. Another important feature of Podman "
"are rootless container builds. Because Podman relies on user namespaces, "
"which provide an isolation mechanism for Linux processes, it does not "
"require root privileges to create and run containers."

"Buildah facilitates building OCI container images. It is a complimentary "
"tool to Podman (see <xref linkend=\"sec-build-tools-podman\"/> ), and "
"<literal>podman build</literal> uses Buildah to perform container image "
"builds. Buildah makes it possible to build images from scratch, from "
"existing images, and using Dockerfiles. OCI images built using the Buildah "
"command-line tool and the underlying OCI-based technologies (for example, "
"<literal>containers/image</literal> and <literal>containers/storage</"
"literal> ) are portable and can therefore run in a Docker environment."

"KIWI Next Generation is a multi-purpose tool for building images. In "

"of creating images with &kiwi; is fully automated and does not require any "

"The image can be customized using the <filename>config.sh</filename> and "
