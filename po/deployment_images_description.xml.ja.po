"&slema; raw images are delivered for the x86_64 architecture (an image with "
"RT kernel is available), IBM ZSeries (an image of the KVM host, images to be "
"used with FBA or DASD devices) and also AArch64. These images are intended "
"to be configured on the first boot by using either Ignition or Combustion. "
"To detect the first boot, each image contains a flag file that is recognized "
"by the boot loader, see more in <xref linkend=\"sec-first-boot\"/> . Each "
"image has default mounted subvolumes as described in <xref linkend=\"sec-"
"default-partitioning\"/> . The procedure of deploying these images is "
"described in <xref linkend=\"cha-images-procedure\"/> ."
