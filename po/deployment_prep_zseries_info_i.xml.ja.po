"If you install &productname; for &zseries; into a logical partition (LPAR), "
"assign memory and processors to the instance. Installing into LPAR is "
"recommended for highly loaded production machines. Running in LPAR also "
"makes higher security standards available. Networking between LPARs is "
"possible over external interfaces or HiperSockets. In case you plan to use "
"your installation for virtualization with KVM, installing into LPAR is "
"highly recommended."

"Running &productname; for &zseries; in z/VM means that &productname; is a "
"guest system within z/VM. An advantage of this mode is that you have full "
"control over &productname; from z/VM. This is very helpful for kernel "
"development or kernel-based debugging. It is also very easy to add or remove "
"hardware to and from Linux guests. Creating additional &productname; guests "
"is simple and you can run hundreds of Linux instances simultaneously."
